# ThirdPersonRacingGame

This project is a small Low-Poly racing game with a third-person controller,  with two racing levels and a small garage, which is an area where the player can quietly change time, improve his car, change its color, buy in-game currency, select the graphics settings and decide which level the player wants to pass.
